This is my Emacs configuration. As a whole, it's probably of little interest,
but it may contain useful snippets.

To use it:
 1. Clone the repo to `~/.emacs.d`.
 1. Launch Emacs, so that `init.el` can install the required third-party packages.
 1. Byte-compile `init.el`. **Do not** try to byte-compile earlier, it **won't
    work**.

Emacs 24.3 or newer is required. I'm not trying to achieve compatibility with
Emacs 24.2 and older.
