This is my Emacs configuration. As a whole, it's probably of little interest,
but it may contain useful snippets.

To use it:
 1. Clone the repo to `~/.emacs.d`.
 1. (optional) Byte-compile `init.el`, either from batch mode or interactively.

The required third-party packages are installed automatically using `package.el`.

Emacs 24.4 or newer is required. I'm not trying to achieve compatibility with
Emacs 24.3 and older.
